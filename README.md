This application was created to meet the need of a loved one to have an assistant for memorization. Indeed, one of the best ways to memorize is through repetition.
Here are the features offered by this application:
- Simple infinite counter
- Create your own counters corresponding to your needs and objectives
- Manage your counters as folders
- Follow-up of your memorization work thanks to advanced statistics
- Re-order counters and folders

This is a project developed by leisure and it is my first application on the store.
